# ns-zombie

Keybinding script for zombie control with multiple puppets. Intended to be used with [firefox containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/cardtainers)

works on fast.nationstates.net!

i recommend using [tree style tabs](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/) when running the script with multiple puppets

# Installation
I use [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) for this, you can use whatever works for you

Download [zombie.user.js](https://github.com/ducky4life/ns-zombie/raw/refs/heads/main/zombie.user.js) (or paste it in your script runner), enter your main nation, run it, enjoy

If you use TamperMonkey, go to the blender.user.js link above and TamperMonkey should pop up automatically with the [Latest Release](https://github.com/ducky4life/ns-zombie/releases/latest)

# Keybinds

```
A: regional activity
S: TZES (kill)
D: cure missiles
F: horde (button name might be wrong)
Z: zombie control page
```

# How to use the script with containers

1. open multiple containers with all of the puppets you will use logged in in each one
2. find a target nation (most zombies in region: https://www.nationstates.net/page=list_nations/region=your_region_here?censusid=82)
3. use your superweapon on one of your puppets, creating a regional zombie activity
4. go to the regional activity page on all of your other puppets, find the activity and click on your target nation on every puppet
5. keep firing your superweapon using the keybinds while switching tabs to other puppets
