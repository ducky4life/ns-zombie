# ns-zombie
get it? because you *blend* puree?

ns-blender is a script to highlight and hide raider owned/not tagged regions on puree from a given list.

# Installation
I use [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) for this, you can use whatever works for you

Download [zombie.user.js](https://github.com/ducky4life/ns-zombie/raw/refs/heads/main/zombie.user.js) (or paste it in your script runner), enter your main nation, run it, enjoy

If you use TamperMonkey, go to the blender.user.js link above and TamperMonkey should pop up automatically with the [Latest Release](https://github.com/ducky4life/ns-zombie/releases/latest)
